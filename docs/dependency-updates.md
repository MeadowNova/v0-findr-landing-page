# Dependency Updates Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to the package dependencies for the SnagrAI project. The updates were performed as part of Task #2: "Update Package Dependencies".

## Changes Made

### Added Missing Dependencies
The following dependencies were added to support the UI components used in the application:

1. **Radix UI Components**:
   - `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`: For alert dialogs
   - `@radix-ui/react-label`: For form labels
   - `@radix-ui/react-select`: For select dropdowns
   - `@radix-ui/react-slider`: For range sliders
   - `@radix-ui/react-slot`: For component composition
   - `@radix-ui/react-toast`: For toast notifications

2. **Utility Libraries**:
   - `class-variance-authority`: For component styling variants
   - `clsx`: For conditional class name joining
   - `tailwind-merge`: For merging Tailwind CSS classes

### Version Updates
- Updated React from v19 to v18.2.0 for compatibility with Radix UI components
- Updated Next.js from v15.2.4 to v14.1.0 for stability
- Updated TypeScript types to match the React version
- Specified exact versions for all dependencies to prevent unexpected updates

### Development Dependencies
Added and updated development dependencies:
- ESLint and ESLint config for Next.js
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Updated TypeScript to v5.4.5

## Testing
The application was tested after dependency updates and confirmed to be working correctly. The development server starts without errors, and the UI components render as expected.

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring for any dependency-related issues
2. Consider implementing a dependency management strategy (e.g., Renovate or Dependabot)
3. Regularly update dependencies to maintain security and performance
