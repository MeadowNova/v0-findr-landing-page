# Database Technology Choices and Operational Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the database technology choices for the Snagr AI application and defines operational procedures for data management. It provides rationale for selected technologies, documents data access patterns, and establishes procedures for data migration, backup, recovery, and security.

## Database Technology Selection

### Primary Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

#### Rationale for Selection

1. **Integrated Authentication**: Supabase provides built-in authentication that integrates seamlessly with the database, simplifying user management and security.

2. **PostgreSQL Foundation**: Built on PostgreSQL, providing a robust, mature, and feature-rich relational database with strong ACID compliance.

3. **Realtime Capabilities**: Supabase offers realtime subscriptions, allowing the application to receive live updates when data changes.

4. **Row-Level Security**: Native support for row-level security policies, enabling fine-grained access control at the database level.

5. **Serverless Architecture**: Aligns with the application's serverless deployment model, reducing operational overhead.

6. **Scalability**: Supabase can scale to handle the expected growth of the application, with options for dedicated instances as needs grow.

7. **JSON/JSONB Support**: Native support for JSON data types, allowing flexible schema evolution for certain fields.

8. **Full-Text Search**: Built-in text search capabilities for implementing search functionality.

9. **Developer Experience**: Excellent developer experience with comprehensive documentation and client libraries.

10. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reasonable pricing model with a free tier for development and testing.

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Firebase (Firestore)**
   - Pros: Excellent realtime capabilities, tight integration with Google Cloud
   - Cons: NoSQL model less suitable for relational data, more limited query capabilities
   - Decision Factor: The relational nature of our data model makes PostgreSQL more appropriate

2. **MongoDB Atlas**
   - Pros: Flexible document model, good scaling capabilities
   - Cons: Less suitable for highly relational data, separate authentication system needed
   - Decision Factor: Need for complex joins and transactions favors PostgreSQL

3. **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**
   - Pros: Highly reliable, excellent scaling options
   - Cons: Requires more operational overhead, separate authentication system needed
   - Decision Factor: Supabase provides a more integrated solution with less operational complexity

### Caching Layer: Redis

For performance optimization, Redis will be used as a caching layer:

1. **Fast In-Memory Storage**: Provides high-performance caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Data Structure Support**: Supports various data structures beyond simple key-value pairs
3. **Expiration Policies**: Built-in TTL capabilities for cache management
4. **Pub/Sub Capabilities**: Can be used for realtime features if needed

## Data Access Patterns

### Read Patterns

1. **User Authentication and Profile**
   - Frequency: High (every user session)
   - Pattern: Point lookup by user ID or email
   - Optimization: Cache user profiles in Redis

2. **Search History**
   - Frequency: Medium
   - Pattern: Range query filtered by user ID, sorted by creation date
   - Optimization: Paginated queries with appropriate indexes

3. **Search Results (Matches)**
   - Frequency: High
   - Pattern: Range query filtered by search ID, sorted by relevance score
   - Optimization: Paginated queries, materialized views for complex filters

4. **Unlocked Listings**
   - Frequency: Medium
   - Pattern: Join query across unlocks, matches, and payments
   - Optimization: Denormalized views, composite indexes

5. **Saved Searches**
   - Frequency: Low
   - Pattern: Filtered by user ID and active status
   - Optimization: Simple indexes, potential caching

### Write Patterns

1. **User Registration**
   - Frequency: Low
   - Pattern: Single-row insert
   - Consideration: Email uniqueness validation

2. **Search Creation**
   - Frequency: High
   - Pattern: Single-row insert followed by job creation
   - Consideration: Transaction to ensure both records are created

3. **Match Creation**
   - Frequency: High (batch)
   - Pattern: Bulk insert of multiple matches
   - Consideration: Batch processing for efficiency

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Frequency: Medium
   - Pattern: Insert payment record, update unlock status
   - Consideration: Transaction to ensure atomicity

5. **Notification Creation**
   - Frequency: Medium (batch)
   - Pattern: Bulk insert for new match notifications
   - Consideration: Batch processing for efficiency

### Access Pattern Optimization

1. **Indexed Fields**: All fields used in WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions are indexed
2. **Composite Indexes**: Created for fields frequently used together in queries
3. **Denormalization**: Strategic denormalization for frequently joined data
4. **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for frequently accessed, relatively static data

## Data Migration Procedures

### Initial Schema Deployment

1. **Schema Creation Script**
   - Use version-controlled SQL scripts for initial schema creation
   - Include all tables, indexes, constraints, and functions
   - Execute in a transaction to ensure atomicity

2. **Seed Data**
   - Deploy essential seed data (e.g., system configurations)
   - Use separate scripts for environment-specific data

### Schema Evolution

1. **Migration Framework**
   - Use a migration framework (e.g., Supabase migrations or custom solution)
   - Each migration has up and down scripts for applying and rolling back changes
   - Migrations are versioned and applied sequentially

2. **Migration Process**
   - Test migrations in development and staging environments
   - Schedule production migrations during low-traffic periods
   - Have rollback plan ready for each migration

3. **Zero-Downtime Migrations**
   - For schema changes that require significant time:
     - Add new structures without removing old ones
     - Gradually migrate data
     - Update application to use new structures
     - Remove old structures after transition period

### Data Import/Export

1. **Bulk Import Process**
   - Use PostgreSQL COPY command for efficient bulk imports
   - Validate data before import
   - Import in transactions with appropriate batch sizes

2. **Data Export Process**
   - Use PostgreSQL COPY command for exports
   - Implement data anonymization for sensitive exports
   - Support various export formats (CSV, JSON)

## Backup and Recovery Procedures

### Backup Strategy

1. **Automated Backups**
   - Daily full database backups
   - Hourly incremental backups
   - Transaction log backups every 5 minutes
   - Retention policy: 7 days of hourly backups, 30 days of daily backups

2. **Backup Storage**
   - Primary storage: Supabase managed backups
   - Secondary storage: Encrypted backups in cloud storage (AWS S3)
   - Geographical redundancy for disaster recovery

3. **Backup Verification**

   - Compress and store in cold storage for long-term retention
   - Maintain index of archived data for potential retrieval

3. **Data Retrieval**
   - Document process for retrieving archived data if needed
   - Implement API endpoints for authorized retrieval requests

## Security Measures

### Data Encryption

1. **Data in Transit**
   - All connections use TLS/SSL encryption

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - Define database roles with appropriate permissions
   - Application uses least-privilege service accounts
   - Admin access requires additional authentication

3. **API Security**
   - All database access through authenticated API endpoints
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Audit and Compliance
