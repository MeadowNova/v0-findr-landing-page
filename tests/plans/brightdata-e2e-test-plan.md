   - Verify that the endpoint validates URL format
   - Test with invalid URLs and verify error handling
   - Verify that the endpoint requires authentication

4. **GET /api/v1/brightdata/quota**
   - Verify that the endpoint returns quota information
   - Check that the response includes total, used, and remaining quota
   - Verify that the endpoint requires authentication

5. **GET /api/v1/brightdata/proxy**
   - Verify that the endpoint returns proxy configuration details
   - Check that the response includes host, port, username, and password
   - Verify that the endpoint requires authentication

### 2. Proxy Configuration Testing

#### Objectives

- Verify that the proxy configuration works correctly
- Test direct API access using the proxy
- Validate zone configuration

#### Test Cases

1. **Proxy Authentication**
   - Verify that proxy authentication works with the provided credentials
   - Test with invalid credentials and verify error handling

2. **Direct API Access**
   - Test direct API access using the proxy configuration
   - Verify that requests are routed through the proxy

3. **Zone Configuration**
   - Verify that the zone is configured correctly for Facebook Marketplace scraping
   - Test with different zone settings

### 3. Facebook Marketplace Scraping Testing

#### Objectives

- Verify that Facebook Marketplace scraping works correctly
- Test with various search parameters and locations
- Validate data extraction

#### Test Cases

1. **Search Results Scraping**
   - Test scraping of Facebook Marketplace search results
   - Verify that all required data fields are extracted
   - Test with various search queries and locations

2. **Individual Listing Scraping**
   - Test scraping of individual Facebook Marketplace listings
   - Verify that all required data fields are extracted
   - Test with various listing types

3. **Category and Filter Testing**
   - Test scraping with different categories and filters
   - Verify that the results match the specified filters

4. **Data Extraction Validation**
   - Verify that all required data fields are correctly extracted
   - Check for missing or incorrect data
   - Validate data formats and types

### 4. Error Handling and Fallback Testing

#### Objectives

- Verify that the system handles errors correctly
- Test fallback mechanisms
- Validate error messages and logging

#### Test Cases

1. **API Unavailability**
   - Simulate Bright Data API unavailability
   - Verify that the system handles the error gracefully
   - Check that appropriate error messages are displayed

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Simulate rate limiting scenarios
   - Verify that the system handles rate limiting correctly
   - Check that retry mechanisms work as expected

3. **Invalid URLs**
   - Test with invalid or malformed URLs
   - Verify that the system handles the error gracefully
   - Check that appropriate error messages are displayed

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Test fallback to mock data when primary scraping fails
   - Verify that the fallback data is displayed correctly
   - Check that the system recovers when the API becomes available again

### 5. Quota Monitoring and Usage Tracking

#### Objectives

- Verify that quota monitoring works correctly
- Test usage tracking
- Validate alerting mechanisms

#### Test Cases

1. **Quota Monitoring**
   - Verify that the system tracks API usage against quota limits
   - Check that quota information is displayed correctly

2. **Usage Tracking**
   - Verify that usage tracking is accurate
   - Test with various API calls and check that usage is tracked correctly

3. **Alerting Mechanisms**
   - Simulate approaching quota limits
   - Verify that alerts are triggered appropriately

### 6. Performance Testing

#### Objectives

- Verify that the system performs well under load
- Test concurrent scraping requests
- Identify and address bottlenecks

#### Test Cases

1. **Load Testing**
   - Test performance under various load conditions
   - Measure response times for different types of requests
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

2. **Concurrent Requests**
   - Test concurrent scraping requests
   - Verify that rate limiting works correctly
   - Check that the system handles concurrent requests gracefully

3. **Caching Performance**
   - Test caching performance
   - Verify that cached responses are returned quickly
   - Measure cache hit rates

## Test Execution

### Test Schedule

1. **Week 1**: Environment setup and API endpoint testing
2. **Week 2**: Proxy configuration and Facebook Marketplace scraping testing
3. **Week 3**: Error handling, fallback, and quota monitoring testing
4. **Week 4**: Performance testing and final validation

### Test Reporting

- Document all test cases and results
- Report any issues or bugs found
- Provide recommendations for improvements
- Create a final test report

## Acceptance Criteria

The Bright Data MCP integration will be considered ready for production when:

1. All API endpoints function correctly and return the expected responses
2. Proxy configuration works correctly for direct API access
3. Facebook Marketplace scraping works correctly with various search parameters
4. Error handling and fallback mechanisms work as expected
5. Quota monitoring and usage tracking are accurate
6. Performance meets the specified requirements
7. All documentation is complete and accurate

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks

1. **API Changes**: Facebook Marketplace or Bright Data API changes could break the integration
2. **Rate Limiting**: Excessive API calls could trigger rate limiting or blocking
3. **Data Quality**: Scraped data might be incomplete or incorrect
4. **Performance Issues**: High load could cause performance degradation

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **API Changes**: Implement robust error handling and monitoring to detect API changes
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting and retry mechanisms
3. **Data Quality**: Implement data validation and fallback mechanisms
4. **Performance Issues**: Implement caching and optimize API calls
