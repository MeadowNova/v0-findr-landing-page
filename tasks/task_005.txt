# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement User Authentication UI
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and connect the login and registration UI components to the Supabase authentication system.
# Details:
1. Create login form component with email and password fields
2. Create registration form component with necessary user information fields
3. Implement form validation for both forms
4. Connect forms to Supabase Auth API using the Supabase JavaScript client
5. Add loading states and error handling
6. Implement session management and protected routes
7. Store authentication token securely
8. Redirect users appropriately after login/registration

# Test Strategy:
Test login and registration with valid and invalid credentials. Verify that error messages are displayed correctly. Test session persistence across page reloads.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Login and Registration Form Components [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the UI components for login and registration forms with all necessary input fields and basic styling.
### Details:
Create two separate React components: LoginForm and RegisterForm. LoginForm should include email and password fields, a submit button, and a link to registration. RegisterForm should include email, password, confirm password, name, and any other required user information fields. Apply consistent styling using the project's design system. Both forms should have proper labels, placeholders, and accessible markup.

## 2. Implement Form Validation Logic [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add client-side validation to both login and registration forms to ensure data quality before submission.
### Details:
Implement validation for all form fields using a form library like Formik or React Hook Form. For email, validate format. For password, enforce minimum length and complexity requirements. For registration, ensure passwords match and all required fields are completed. Display appropriate error messages below each field when validation fails. Disable submit buttons until forms are valid.

## 3. Connect Forms to Supabase Authentication API [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Integrate the form components with Supabase authentication methods to enable user login and registration functionality.
### Details:
Use the Supabase JavaScript client to connect form submissions to the appropriate auth endpoints. For login, implement the signIn method with email and password. For registration, use the signUp method with all required user data. Add loading states during API calls by disabling form inputs and showing a spinner. Implement comprehensive error handling to display user-friendly messages for different error scenarios (invalid credentials, email already in use, etc.).

## 4. Implement Authentication State Management [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create a system to manage and persist user authentication state throughout the application.
### Details:
Set up a context provider (AuthProvider) using React Context API to manage authentication state. Store the user object and auth token from Supabase in state. Implement hooks for checking authentication status (useAuth) and user information. Set up secure storage of the authentication token using localStorage or cookies with appropriate security measures. Add listeners for auth state changes from Supabase to keep the local state in sync.

## 5. Create Protected Routes and Navigation Flow [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement route protection for authenticated content and set up appropriate redirects after authentication events.
### Details:
Create a ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication status and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page. Implement redirect logic after successful login/registration to take users to the appropriate dashboard or home page. Add a logout function that clears authentication state and redirects to the login page. Ensure the navigation bar updates based on authentication status, showing appropriate options for logged-in vs. logged-out users.
